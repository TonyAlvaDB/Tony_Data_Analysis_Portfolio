[Proyect 1: Chess](https://github.com/TonyAlvaDB/Tony_Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Proyecto%201/Chess.ipynb)<br>
Proyect 1 is an analisys of a Chess games dataset. In here, I was able to discover interesting patterns and information that will lead you to have more chances to win your Chess games. For this one I used Python with Pandas and Matplotlib.<br>

[Proyect 2: Sales Report](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/08acb813-c69c-4d41-ba2c-49a6b3853255/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)<br>
Proyect 2 is a disovery adventure with Power Bi. I took a sample Dataset that I found online, and created this report showing the most important aspects of it.

[Proyect 3: Walmart Sales Report](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/a53b59e3-7398-4826-8c40-e69394f836a0/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)<br>
For proyect 3 I found a little DataSet regarding Walmart Sales. This is a small report on the different movements (Warehouse sales, Retail sales, Retail transfers) with Power Bi (I used SQL Management Studio to update the CSV and then import it to Power Bi). It also contains information about suppliers and items listed. It can be sorted by year.
